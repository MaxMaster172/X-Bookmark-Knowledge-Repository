The $LITE thesis: The hidden monopoly in the AI. 

Lumentum is up 316% YTD, but might be 1000%+ by 2027. 

Micron ($300B) or TSM ($1.5T) sit in the center of every TPU/GPU deployed. 

But same with $LITE, but it's a $26B MC. 

In Every, Single, TPU from Google, $LITE makes unbelievable amounts of profit for their marketcap. 

That's because it's the standard for Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) + optical networking. 

It's also in

-  $NVDA Blackwell
-$AMZN Trainium
- and other hyperscaler ASICs.  

Lumentum sits in the holy trinity of every single chip deployment for photonics.

And for every TPU capex spent, $LITE takes 8-12%. For every Nvidia GPU, $LITE takes ~2-3% (split between Innolight and some others, so the math gets a bit complex).

But some napkin math on NVDA GPU deployments alone for BOM:

NVIDIA Blackwell (GB200):

HBM memory: ~50–55% (SK Hynix (Lead), Micron, Samsung)
Logic (GPU Die): ~25-30% ( $TSM 4NP)
CoWoS Packaging: ~13-18% $TSM
Optics/Network: ~3–5% (Innolight, Lumentum, Coherent)
PCB/Power: 5%

For Google TPIU "Ironwood" TPU v7:

HBM Memory: 38-42% Samsung / SK Hynix
Logic Die: TSM ~28-33%
Design/I.O: 8-10% MediaTek 
Optical Network: 10-14% ( $LITE (primary), $COHR secondary)
Optical Switch: 2-4% $LITE

$LITE est. total cluster share: ~8–12%

Just an FYI, Google's "Optical" BOM share (8–12%) is an anomaly due to their unique Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) monopoly.

Just for some napkin math:

$40B Google TPU spend by 2027. $LITE captures 10% (30-40% margins), $1.5B+ FCF from Google alone, 17x earnings from just their primary customer. (analysts are probably extremely off with projecting TPU spend scaling). 

Not even including their split from $AMZN Trainium, $NVDA Blackwell, $MSFT Maia, and other chip deployments. 

$LITE is in the center of every single TPU/GPU future chip deployment for now and takes a cut. 

The only downside is they're the clear market leader now, but $AVGO and $COHR are likely set up to compete by 2027-2028. However...

People say "$26B, ATH, why are you buying now". 

This is the reason. They're involved in every future single TPU/GPU/ASIC deployed. 

$LITE could end up easily over $60B+ if Google TPUs, and other chip spend ramps up and LITE takes a 2-3% (from $NVDA, $AMZN, $MSFT) or 8-12% cut (from $GOOGL) for every single dollar spent.
