With Claude Code, it is now possible to have a permanent at-the-very-least-intern-level assistant doing 24/7 research jobs for you and also building the software tooling to act on that data. Admin panels, automated media conversion, building ideal libraries, and monitoring competitors. All that and more.

Between MCPs, Cloud for Chrome, and Skills, if you don't have your agentic tool churn through your work backlog all day long, you are quite literally missing out. 

Because every day, more and more of your competitors will do exactly this. And while a lot of this currently is clunky, haphazard, and DIY, you can be absolutely sure that this will be commoditized within the next six months.
